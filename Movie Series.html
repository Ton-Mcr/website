    <p1 class="container1">In 1996, a sequel was released, called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow:_City_of_Angels">The Crow: City of Angels</a></i>.

The band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deftones" title="Deftones">Deftones</a> can be seen playing live in a festival scene and they contributed the song "Teething" to the soundtrack. The film received mostly negative reviews. The film was followed by a television series and two direct-to-video sequels, each with a different person as The Crow.</p1>

</div>

<div><h2>Reboot</h2></div>
<br>
<div class="text6">
    <p5 class="container5">On December 14, 2008, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Norrington" title="Stephen Norrington">Stephen Norrington</a> announced in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> that he planned to write and direct a "reinvention" of <i>The Crow</i>. Norrington distinguished between the original and his remake: "Whereas Proyas' original was gloriously gothic and stylized, the new movie will be realistic, hard-edged and mysterious, almost documentary-style."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Kavanaugh" title="Ryan Kavanaugh">Ryan Kavanaugh</a> then announced on November 23, 2009, that his company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Media" title="Relativity Media">Relativity Media</a>, was in negotiations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Pressman" title="Edward R. Pressman">Edward R. Pressman</a> for both the film's rights and financing.</p5>
</div>
<br>
<div class="text6">
    <p6 class="container6">Norrington later stepped out of the project and, on April 7, 2011, it was announced that <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Weeks_Later" title="28 Weeks Later">28 Weeks Later</a></i> director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Fresnadillo" title="Juan Carlos Fresnadillo">Juan Carlos Fresnadillo</a> had been chosen to direct the film, which has since been regarded as a remake. Tucker Tooley of Relativity Media was chosen serve as executive producer, while Jose Ibanez, Jon Katz and Jesus de la Vega were to serve as co-producers. Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Cooper" title="Bradley Cooper">Bradley Cooper</a> was in talks to play the lead. It was reported on April 20, 2011, that the project was undergoing some legal battles. In late June 2011, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_Media" title="Relativity Media">Relativity Media</a> announced their plans to continue in mid-lawsuit and had tapped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Tse" title="Alex Tse">Alex Tse</a>, who co-wrote the movie <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)" title="Watchmen (film)">Watchmen</a></i>. In mid-August 2011, it was announced that Cooper had dropped out due to scheduling difficulties and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wahlberg" title="Mark Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a>, who was originally in talks for the lead in 2010, was again up for the part, with additional rumors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channing_Tatum" title="Channing Tatum">Channing Tatum</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Gosling" title="Ryan Gosling">Ryan Gosling</a> possibly taking the role, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McAvoy" title="James McAvoy">James McAvoy</a>. In October 2011, it was reported that Fresnadillo had departed the project as well. It was confirmed in January 2012 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Javier_Guti%C3%A9rrez" class="mw-redirect" title="Francisco Javier Gutiérrez">Francisco Javier Gutiérrez</a> had signed on to direct the remake, with Edward R. Pressman and Jeff Most on producing duties.</p6>
</div>
<br>
<div class="text7">
    <p7 class="container7">In June 2012, producer Edward R. Pressman assured fans that "the original 1994 <i>Crow</i> film holds a special place in my heart. The current film is a 'reinvention' of James O'Barr's graphic novel for the 21st century. We're thrilled to have teamed with director Javier Gutiérrez and screenwriter Jesse Wigutow on this story, which remains true to the core of Eric Draven's plight for revenge. On the news of future remakes, however, O'Barr stated: "[...] I don't have great expectations. I think the reality is, no matter who you get to star in it, or if you get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott">Ridley Scott</a> to direct it and spend 200 million dollars, you're still not gonna top what Brandon Lee and Alex Proyas did in that first ten million dollar movie." On April 19, 2013, it was announced that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hiddleston" title="Tom Hiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a> was in talks to play Eric. That same month, there were reports that Hiddleston would not be doing the film, but that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Skarsg%C3%A5rd" title="Alexander Skarsgård">Alexander Skarsgård</a> was being eyed for the part.

Evans reaffirmed to Superhero Hype that the film would be as faithful as possible to the original. On July 3, 2013, <i>The Crow</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s creator James O'Barr was named as the creative consultant of the film. In an October 2015 interview, O'Barr would discuss what had changed his mind about the reboot, and efforts to make the reboot a more faithful adaptation of the comic book, while remaining respectful to the original film. On November 21, 2013, Schmoes Know had reports that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Reedus" title="Norman Reedus">Norman Reedus</a> was up for the role of a character named "James", and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Stewart" title="Kristen Stewart">Kristen Stewart</a> had at one time been considered for the part of Shelly. In December 2014, the studio hired Corin Hardy to direct the film. Evans told Den of Geek in an interview that he might not do the film, and it was later revealed that Evans has dropped out of the film due to other projects. On February 9, 2015, O'Barr told Blastr in an interview that he was interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Witwer" title="Sam Witwer">Sam Witwer</a> for the role.</p8>
</div>
<br>
<div class="text9">
    <p9 class="container9">As of October 24, 2014, the film was set to start production in the spring of 2015. On February 25, 2015, it was reported that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Huston" title="Jack Huston">Jack Huston</a> would be starring in the film.

On May 20, 2015, Deadline reports that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Riseborough" title="Andrea Riseborough">Andrea Riseborough</a> is in talks to co-star as the female version of Top Dollar.

On September 6, 2016, <i>TheWrap</i> reports that Momoa is cast and filming will begin in January 2017. On November 17, 2016, <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> has reported that Highland Film Group and Electric Shadow have acquired the rights to finance, produce, and distribute the film (now titled <i>The Crow Reborn</i>) from Relativity but may lose both Momoa and Hardy.

<br>
<div class="text10">

</div>
<br>
<div class="text11">
    <p11 class="container11">In November 2019, Proyas said in an interview on a podcast of a reboot:<br><br><blockquote><p>I personally tried to squash it every time I hear of one, not that I believe I've been able to. I think extenuating circumstances have stopped it being made because if Hollywood wants to make something that they don't listen to schmucks like me who bring noble and moralistic issues. My point is that Brandon Lee made that movie what it is. He made that movie, he made that character. That character was not taken from a comic book, that was Brandon. And Brandon Lee died making that movie, he paid the worst price anyone could ever pay making a movie and it's his legacy. The guy would have been a huge star after that movie. He wasn't able to ever do that. That's his final testimony to his talent and that's why I finished the movie. I finished it for Brandon. After being devastated about what happened we shut down the production and I went back to Australia. Months later I went back and watched the movie and his family all the other actors, everyone involved, said 'You've got to finish this movie because Brandon is so great in it' and he was. I was able to watch it and see how great he was and I thought then the movie deserves to be completed because it's his legacy. So that's what the movie is, it's not just a movie that can be remade. It's one man's legacy. And it should be treated with that level of respect.</p></blockquote></p11>
