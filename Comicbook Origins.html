    <div><h3>Plot</h3></div>
    <div class="text1">
        <p1 class="container1">The story revolves around an unfortunate young man named Eric. He and his fiancée, Shelly, are assaulted by a gang of street thugs after their car breaks down. Eric is shot in the head and is paralyzed, and can only watch as Shelly is savagely beaten, raped, and then shot in the head. They are then left for dead on the side of the road. Eric later dies in the hospital operating room while Shelly is DOA.

            He is resurrected by a crow and seeks vengeance on the murderers, methodically stalking and killing them. When not on the hunt, Eric stays in the house he shared with Shelly, spending most of his time there, lost in memories of her. Her absence is torture for him; he is in emotional pain, even engaging in self-mutilation by cutting himself.
            
            The crow acts as both a guide and goad for Eric, giving him information that helps him in his quest but also chastising him for dwelling on Shelly's death, seeing his pining as useless self-indulgence that distracts him from his purpose.</p1>

    <div><h3>Media</h3></div>
    <div class="text2">
        <p2 class="container2">The Crow first appeared on the back cover of Deadworld #10 (November 1988); James O'Barr provided a back cover to the first comic book Caliber Press published, which contained an advertisement for the upcoming The Crow appearance in Caliber Presents #1. (The ads shows The Crow standing with a smoking shotgun in one hand and a samurai sword in the other, with the statement, "For Some Things...There Is No Forgiveness". It mentions The Crow appearing in February 1989.)

    The Crow's first in-story appearance was in Caliber Presents #1 (January 1989), in the story "Inertia", which serves as a prequel to the main series. O'Barr again provided a back cover for this issue.
    
    The character's first limited series was The Crow #1–4 (February–May 1989). Four issues, titled "Pain", "Fear", "Irony", and "Despair," take readers through a series of vengeance tales as The Crow cuts and shoots through Tin-Tin, Tom-Tom, Top Dollar, Funboy and T-Bird, the gang members that attacked and killed him and his lover Shelly.
    
    In A Caliber Christmas (December 1989), Eric reflects back on happier times with Shelly in the story "Atmosphere." (In The Crow graphic novel, this story is placed between issues #2 and 3.)
    
    Caliber Presents #15 (September 1990) contained a key preview of The Crow #5, titled "Death" which was left unpublished. The preview was a story to conclude the original arc.</p2>

    <p8 class="container8">O'Barr stated in a 2004 interview that an Author's Edition would contain at least "60 pages of new material that no one has ever seen. Half of that are pages that had to be removed for space reasons." O'Barr described the additions as including "more romance flashback scenes between Eric and Shelly," as well as sequences that would make the work "more visually interesting."On January 16, 2010, it was announced on O'Barr's official website that the Author's Edition of <i>The Crow</i> was indeed going to be released and that O'Barr was currently working on it. On April 7, 2011, O'Barr announced that <i>The Crow: Special Edition</i> would be released on July 28, 2011, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_Publishing_Group" title="Gallery Publishing Group">Gallery Books</a>.

<div><h3>Comicbook Cast</h3></div>
<div class="container17">
    <ul2>
        <li>Eric: The main character. He was shot in the head and paralyzed, having seen all the brutal things done to Shelly, dying shortly after. A year after his death, his soul is brought back into his dead body. Unlike the movie, however, since Eric is basically a walking corpse, he does not heal and is totally invulnerable. The fact that there are no conditions or limitations to Eric's presence or powers gives the character a unique presence that does not exist in any other hero. He is completely unstoppable compared to any other mortal character in his universe.</li>
        <li>The crow (bird): serves as a guide to Eric as well as a companion. Unlike in the movie, the crow is not a real bird but a spirit that only Eric sees (and T-Bird, once, at the very end). Given its nature, it cannot be killed.</li>
        <li>The Skull Cowboy: a dark character that exists mostly to keep Eric on track in his mission and keep him from becoming too attached to his memories.</li>
        <li>Shelly: Fiancée of Eric who gets raped and killed by T-Bird's gang. She appears in Eric's dreams and memories.</li>
        <li>Sherri: A young street girl whom Eric meets while going after Funboy. Sherri is shown as upset, due to her mother not being there for her, and even goes so far as to tell Eric that she believes she's been bad and God sent her to Hell. She and Eric seem to bond closely, and feeling sorry for her, Eric gives her Shelly's engagement ring. She's overjoyed, because no one has ever given her a gift before, and she calls him a "clown" while he calls her a "princess". She is renamed Sarah in the film adaptation.</li>
        <li>T-Bird: The head of the gang that murders Shelly and Eric.</li>
        <li>Funboy: T-Bird's right-hand man, a morphine addict who is sleeping with Sherri's mother.</li>
        <li>Top Dollar: A low-level drug dealer who also participated in gang-raping Shelly; in the film adaptation, he is the main antagonist rather than T-Bird.</li>
        <li>Tin-Tin: The first of T-Bird's gang to be eliminated by Eric.</li>
        <li>Tom-Tom: Another of T-Bird's soldiers and one of Shelly's rapists, whom Eric interrogates over the whereabouts of Shelly's ring. Tom-Tom is absent from the film adaptation and his role is largely rewritten into a new character, Skank.</li>
        <li>Gideon: A pawnbroker who fences Shelly's engagement ring after it is given to him by T-Bird; in the film adaptation, Tin-Tin gives him the ring.</li>
        <li>Officer Albrecht: A beat cop who confronts Eric outside of Gideon's pawnshop.</li>
        <li>Captain Hook: The detective who originally handled Eric and Shelly's case. Eric sends him his regards through Albrecht.</li>
